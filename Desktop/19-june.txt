hi shiva..
i never knew that iam going to be so sure about anything in my life but this is something i am so sure and iam liking this ,infact after having this type of clarity iam reliefed no grudges,no expectations only self satisfaction and truth.the truest part is that i dont want him anymore in my life .no, no more chances or struggle now the time has come to free myself from all the things which tied my wings,now i know whatever is going to be there iam sure for one thing i dont want him in mylife, this doesnt mean that iam going to hate him or spread rumors about him but this simply means his position in my life is no more going to be the same,i dont know whether he ever goig to realise what he lost but if there isn't a self realisation of what he did was wrong then i don't think so that he's ever going to realise everything else also.
Shiva just one request..ishan had told me in order to forget him i have to hate him but i dont want i can't hate someone without any reason or i should say that despite of having reason i don't want to hate him.please be with me ,just be there everytime.
